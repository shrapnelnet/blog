Songs of the week 2 mf!!!!!

### in another life - pikaro

Released last week, erin is the latest album from pikaro. don't tell me this isn't breakcore and drop me the same old spiel about erm speedcore erm mashcore erm this is ambient dnb. i've heard it! i believe you! leave me alone and head back henceforth to the primary school you enjoy despite being 23.

In another life is an excellent song. The vocal samples are excellent, and they did something interesting with an amen break which is quite difficult considering how ubiquitous it is in the genre. I love the bass underlying the entire song, it gives an incredible structure to the whole song, and the synths on top keep a brilliant pace to the song. 

The song has a pretty uplifting motif throughout, and it feels similar to a lot of the stuff shinyflvres is putting out, while still having a strong sense of individuality. It's something you could dance or relax to, and I've loved it since it came out.

### school violins - whitelight

An excellent single by whitelight, an artist who I consider very underrated. This song reminds me of the early works of goreshit, with excellent chops and a brilliant drum sample heard throughout.

The song almost seems foggy and confusing (not in a bad way) with all the different effects applied but in an organized chaos kind of way. Whitelight was introduced to me by a friend who loves the genre and I'm thankful for it every day.

Give it a listen !! 

### Heaven in Your Head - Nuclear Daisies

The vocals in this song remind me a lot of pastel ghost (or maybe LSD and the search for god), who I really love. Sort of ethereal dreamy sounds, distorted riffs. Maybe this is shoegaze or dreampop. I just like it!

It feels like a rainy day look out of the window kind of song. Not really very angsty, more of like a song that would play during a characters moment of desperation in a movie.

I encourage any fans of shoegaze to give it a listen. It feels fresh and I don't get tired of relistening to it like so many songs in the genre.

### Unrelated music fun fact #1

Did you know just like heaven by the cure is about making out with someone until they hyperventilate? this is why the smiths will never be better than the cure.
