been too uninspired to write lately, so now you get a comic instead. i live !

no drawing tablet, just true warrior GIMP plus a mouse. i dont think i have a future in art.

![Comic captioned "American television". Image of television, screen reads "general masturbatory first amendment fanservice". banner below reads "fear, uncertainty and doubt are good, actually". subtitle below that reads "immgrants are eating babies that we were saving for social security recipients"](/assets/uploads/americantelevision.png "American television")
