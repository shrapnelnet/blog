### Kicking it off

Recently, my tastes have swayed a lot towards 80s music. kind of a phase i guess. but i've been big on listening to it again for the first time in a while.

I've also been enjoying jazz for a while now too. Mostly Chet Baker, who has a beautiful voice and deserved a more dignified death than falling off a balcony

### Song 1: Squids - Sewerslvt

Squids makes use of a lot of classic UKG samples, as well as a lot of sounds I hear in older techno and electronica. Possibly the best song in her entire catalogue, nice rough amen breaks and a song I could see myself having a good time with at a rave. 100% leans more towards DnB than breakcore.

### Song 2: Isn't it Midnight - Fleetwood Mac

Fleetwood Mac felt like an easy pick at first until I realised that this song had only 14 million streams on Spotify. I am utterly convinced that this is the best song in their catalogue, for the incredible ending riffs, angelic vocals and just all around on the nose 80's vibes throughout. Doubly impressive that they managed to make such an incredible performance in the studio while coked out of their minds. I can't judge though it was the 80's everyone was doing coke.

### Song 3: King Diamond - Team Sleep

Quality vocals in this one. Can't vouch for the message since i can never understand what the hell chino moreno is saying but the whole song just has this otherworldly feel to it, like it was written in the future (see: LFO - LFO). A lot of songs from this album were postponed and released under Deftones debut album.
